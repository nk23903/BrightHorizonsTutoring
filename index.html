        <h2>Where learning doesn’t stop at “sky is the limit.”</h2>
        <p>
          Bright Horizons Tutoring offers warm, structured after-school support in 
          <strong>math</strong> and <strong>reading</strong> for elementary and middle school students. 
          We focus on filling skill gaps, building strong foundations, and helping learners feel proud of what 
          they can do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every student is different, so we take the time to get to know their strengths, challenges, and goals. 
          From decoding and comprehension to fractions and word problems, we break concepts down into clear, 
          approachable steps and practice them in ways that feel encouraging—not overwhelming.

        <h3>Math Support</h3>
        <p>
          We help students move from “I don’t get it” to “I can do this.” Sessions mix skills practice, 
          word problems, and strategy coaching so learners know not just what the answer is, but how to get there.
