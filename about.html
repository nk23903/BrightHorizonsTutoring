        <h2>Bright Horizons began with a simple belief: every child deserves a soft place to land with learning.</h2>
        <p>
          Bright Horizons Tutoring was created for students who need more than just extra worksheets. 
          We exist for learners who benefit from patient explanations, positive encouragement, and a space 
          where it’s okay to ask, “Can you show me that one more time?”

          <p>
            Bright Horizons was founded by <strong>Sophie Fiza</strong>, who was a part of a passionate group of educators that believe every child deserves the chance to reach their full academic potential. She started Bright Horizons as a small after school program in Richmond, Virginia and expanded for maximum progress for students all over!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sophie’s vision is simple: create tutoring spaces where students feel safe to try, supported when 
            they struggle, and proud when they grow. Her goal is to make learning feel lighter, more hopeful, 
            and truly within reach.

        <h3>How we support students and families</h3>
        <p>
          At Bright Horizons, we focus on more than just getting through tonight’s homework. We work alongside 
          families to understand each student’s needs in math and reading, then design a plan that fits their pace, 
          personality, and goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our sessions balance structure with encouragement: clear explanations, guided practice, and space for 
          questions—paired with consistent check-ins so families always know how things are going. We want learners 
          to feel seen, not rushed, and to leave each session feeling a little more confident than when they arrived.

          <h4>Vision &amp; Values</h4>
          <p>
            Our work is guided by compassion, clarity, and consistency. We create calm, encouraging spaces where 
            mistakes are part of learning, not something to be ashamed of. We value honest communication, realistic 
            goals, and steady, meaningful progress for every student.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Students feeling capable—not overwhelmed</li>
            <li>Real growth in math and reading foundations</li>
            <li>Partnership with families, not one-way updates</li>

    <!-- OUR VISION STRIP -->
    <section class="strip strip-vision">
      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Our vision is to help shape a generation of students who see challenges as opportunities, not roadblocks. 
        We want Bright Horizons to be more than a place to “fix” grades—it should feel like a place where students 
        rediscover what they’re capable of, one step at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        By blending thoughtful instruction, caring mentorship, and strong family partnerships, we hope every learner 
        who passes through Bright Horizons walks away with skills they can use, confidence they can feel, and a belief 
        that their future truly stretches beyond the horizon.
